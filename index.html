		I'm currently a first year engineering student at The University of Texas at Austin! However, I am in the process of transfering into computer science. I am still trying to figure out for myself what I'm intersted in, and so far I have concluded that I am not interested in mechanical engineering. But because of this, I am often trying to find new oppurtunities and experiences to help me find topics that I enjoy learning and studying about.

		Beyond academia, I have a few hobbies that I am very passionate about. I absolutely love Super Smash Brothers Melee. I have been playing it competively for the past two years and casually since I was a child.
