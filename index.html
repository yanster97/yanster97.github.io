		I am currently a sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Science. However, it is my first year in the program as I switched into CS this fall. I am quite happy with the change of pace and studies! Even though the classes are more challenging, the content is interesting and engaging, which is what matters the most to me.

		Beyond academia, I have a few hobbies that I am very passionate about. I absolutely love Super Smash Brothers Melee. I have been playing it competively for the past three years and casually since I was a child. No other game compares to Melee in its complexity and style of gameplay. As pro player Joseph "Mang0" Marquez put it best, "Melee has endless ceiling of how good you can be, and your goal is to play perfect, but it is impossible". This endless road of improvement and learning has me always wanting more. This Summer (2016) I started a project that automates the Super Smash Brothers tournament process. Read more about it here.

		I also love music. I have been a percussionist for the past six years, and pianist for nine years. I constantly look for oppurtunities to express myself musically, whether through ensemble groups or just jamming with my friends.
