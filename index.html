		I am currently a sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Science. However, it is my first year in the program as I switched into CS this fall. I am quite happy with the change of pace and studies! Even though the classes are more challenging, the content is interesting and engaging, which is what matters the most to me. Mechanical Engineering was a lot of memorization and identifying certain types of problems, and then applying what I knew from previous examples to solve those problems. Computer Science is quite different in that I don't have a strict template in my head, but have to find the right puzzle pieces and put them together. I often find myself reverting to trying to code based off a template, but usually this slows me down or makes me tunnel vision, so I've been trying to think about my assignments and coding differently, which is hard. I enjoy the challenge though, and learning to think in a new way is always exciting.

		Beyond academia, I have a few hobbies that I am very passionate about. I absolutely love Super Smash Brothers Melee. It has endless road of improvement and learning has me always wanting more. This Summer (2016) I started a project that automates the Super Smash Brothers tournament process, hoping to actually make an impact in the Smash community. The project has been moving farely slowly as school started up, but I hope to finish it this upcoming summer (2017).

		I also love music. I have been a percussionist for the past six years, and pianist for nine years. I constantly look for oppurtunities to express myself musically, whether through ensemble groups or just jamming with my friends.
