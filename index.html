		I'm currently a first year engineering student at The University of Texas at Austin! However, I am in the process of transfering into computer science. I am still trying to figure out for myself what I'm intersted in, and so far I have concluded that I am not interested in mechanical engineering. But because of this, I am often trying to find new oppurtunities and experiences to help me find topics that I enjoy learning and studying about.

		Beyond academia, I have a few hobbies that I am very passionate about. I absolutely love Super Smash Brothers Melee. I have been playing it competively for the past two years and casually since I was a child. No other game compares to Melee in its complexity and style of gameplay. As pro player Joseph "Mang0" Marquez put it best, "Melee has endless ceiling of how good you can be, and your goal is to play perfect, but it is impossible". This endless road of improvement and learning has me always wanting more. By playing other players, you can see how much you've improved and analyze what you could be doing better.

		I also love music. I have been a percussionist for the past six years, and pianist for nine years. I constantly look for oppurtunities to express myself musically, whether through ensemble groups or just jamming with my friends.
