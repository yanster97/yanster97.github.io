		I am currently a senior at the University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Science. I was originally studying mechanical engineering but switched into CS my sophomore year.

		<!--Beyond academia, I have a few hobbies that I am very passionate about. I absolutely love Super Smash Brothers Melee. It has endless road of improvement and learning has me always wanting more. This Summer (2016) I started a project that automates the Super Smash Brothers tournament process, hoping to actually make an impact in the Smash community. The project has been moving farely slowly as school started up, but I hope to finish it this upcoming summer (2017).-->

		<!--I also love music. I have been a percussionist for the past six years, and pianist for nine years. I constantly look for oppurtunities to express myself musically, whether through ensemble groups or just jamming with my friends.-->
